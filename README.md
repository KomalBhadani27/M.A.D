# M.A.D
Submission portal for M.A.D. competition.


## Submission Rules:
Once you are ready to make the final submission fork the repo and add a folder and rename it to your team name. Then copy your project folder into it. Also create the debug-apk of your app and add it to your folder. Add a readme (or add a text file with your problem statement 1).

So, basically it should look like this

###### path -> your_team_name -> project_folder
###### path -> your_team_name -> debug-apk
###### path -> your_team_name -> text-file with problem statement number.


Finally push the changes to your local brach and create a pull request.


These are the problem statements for M.A.D.


### Problem Statement 1 - Category: Crime Control

Problem: We all know the humanity comprises of 50% of the fairer sex. But the same is facing some issues which either they are not very well aware or even if they are they dont know the way out. And that problem is domestic violence. 

As a good samaritans, you have to make an app, 
a) which let females know about what domestic violence is 
b) Rules and regulations which can safeguard their interest
c) some emergency buttons which can ask for quick help from the police/family members in case of dangers( in terms of chat or call ealthlike 100)



### Problem Statement 2 - Category: Social Problem

Problem: 

Every girl around age go into puberty and till menopause which is generally around 50 face the issue of periods. This is a very natural phenomenon, but still there is a taboo and womens dont talk about that and the pads etc which is must for them is not easily available. So most of the time they compromise and avoid participating in many activities. You have to device an app in such a way so that, 
a) Any women anywhere  and any time, if she needs a pad can simply order the pad for home delivery on the basis of her requirement and timing
b) Also just as google lets user explore the area, it can also lets user explore it to find the areas where they can easily go and purchase them.( ex like medical stores/ ladies product shops)


### Problem Statement 3 - Category: Social Problem 

Problem:

To be a mother is the best feeling in the world. And breastfeeding the baby is very natural and very important both for mother and child. But sometimes when the ladies are in market or such other areas, and the new born baby needs to be breastfed, it very difficult to find a place where she can go and do that. Most of the time either they use artificial milk products to feed or have to do that in compromised situation, not very acceptable to our society. If we can have an app which 
a) Can locate the areas where the mothers can go and feed their baby
and extra features that you think will be helpful


## Judging Criteria
The criteria for judging the submitted apps are :
The UI/UX of the app : From how to easy to use and decent looking the app is to how smooth and snappy it performs will be the major criteria for judging the app.
In case of a tie we would consider how decoupled and organised your code is. So, make sure you keep this in mind while writing the code.
